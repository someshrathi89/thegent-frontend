## Short Description (80 characters)
Your personal style system. AI-powered outfits, colors & hairstyles for you.

## Full Description

Ever spent money on clothes but still felt like something was "off"?

You're not alone. Most men dress based on trends, brand names, or random advice — and end up looking average despite the effort.

TheGent changes that.

This isn't another fashion app. It's a personal style intelligence system that analyzes YOUR unique features and tells you exactly what works for YOU.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HOW IT WORKS

1. Upload 3 photos (face, full-body, wrist)
2. Our AI analyzes your face shape, body proportions & skin undertone
3. Get your complete style blueprint — personalized hairstyles, colors, and outfits

That's it. No guesswork. No generic advice. Just clear answers tailored to your features.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT YOU GET

◆ Face Shape Analysis
Discover your face shape and get hairstyles + beard styles that actually complement your features.

◆ Skin Tone & Color Palette
Find your undertone and unlock the colors that make you look healthy, sharp, and put-together.

◆ 16 Personalized Outfit Visuals
Ready-to-wear outfit combinations for every occasion — work, casual, dates, gym, weddings, and more.

◆ 90-Day Style Transformation Journey

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHO IS THIS FOR?

✓ Men who want to look better but don't know where to start
✓ Guys who've wasted money on clothes that don't suit them
✓ Professionals who want to dress sharp without hiring a stylist
✓ Anyone tired of "what should I wear today?" confusion

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHY THEGENT?

Most style advice is generic. "Wear navy." "Try slim fit." "Invest in basics."

But what works for one man doesn't work for another. Your face shape, body type, and skin tone are YOURS — your style should be too.

TheGent gives you a personalized style system based on the same principles used by celebrity stylists — now available to every man.
